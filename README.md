Machine learning tools for the analysis of large document collections. A brief description of each of them is given, even though each has it's own documentation.

The available repositories, divided by tasks are:

Spark implementation of parallel algorithms:
- **DistributedCWLM**: distributed, interpretable regression algorithm in Spark.
- **SVM_spark**: distributed, non-linear, semiparametric SVM implementation in Spark.
- **pysparkMVA**: distributed implementation of Deep Learning for Margin Valuation Adjustment with regularization.

Topic Models tools:
- **TMtweets**: topic modeling pipeline. Designed to work with tweets, but can be extended to other documents.
- **labelFactory**: a generic application for labelling a subset of sites in a web site collection, or a subset of docs in a text collection.
- **one_def_classification**: dataless text classification using definitions as labeled data.
- **WeakLabelModel**: a library for training multiclass classifiers with weak labels.

Integration of modules:
- **PTL_data**: ETL & lemmatization tool for PTL.
- **DB_expl**: Exploratory Data Analysis of mySQL databases.
- **dbManager**: Python class for managing mySQL or sqlite databases.
- **menuNavigator**: a generic template application to generate command-line menus.

Feature Selection and Feature Extraction: 
- **regMVA**: Deep Learning for Margin Valuation Adjustment with regularization.
- **SSHIBA**: generalized Bayesian approach to feature extraction for heterogeneous data.
- **KSSHIBA**: kernelized observation SSHIBA.

Graph synthesis, processing and analysis.
- **supergraph**: a software package for the synthesis, analysis and processing of large graphs.
