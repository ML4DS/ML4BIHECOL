# ML4BIHECOL

Machine learning tools for the analysis of large document collections. A brief description of each of them is given, even though each has it's own documentation.

The available repositories, divided by tasks are:

Spark implementation of parallel algorithms:
- DistributedCWLM: distributed, interpretable regression algorithm in Spark.
- SVM_spark: distributed, non-linear, semiparametric SVM implementation in Spark.
- pysparkMVA: distributed implementation of Deep Learning for Margin Valuation Adjustment with regularization.

Topic Models tools:
- TMtweets: topic modeling pipeline. Designed to work with tweets, but can be extended to other documents.
- labelFactory: a generic application for labelling a subset of sites in a web site collection, or a subset of docs in a text collection.
- one_def_classification: dataless text classification using definitions as labeled data.
- WeakLabelModel: a library for training multiclass classifiers with weak labels.

Integration of modules:
- PTL_data: ETL & lemmatization tool for PTL.
- DB_expl: Exploratory Data Analysis of mySQL databases.
- dbManager: Python class for managing mySQL or sqlite databases.
- menuNavigator: a generic template application to generate command-line menus.

Feature Selection and Feature Extraction: 
- regMVA: Deep Learning for Margin Valuation Adjustment with regularization.
- SSHIBA: generalized Bayesian approach to feature extraction for heterogeneous data.
- KSSHIBA: kernelized observation SSHIBA.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ML4DS/ML4BIHECOL/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ML4DS/ML4BIHECOL/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
